# What have you done this past week?

This past week was the busiest of the semester thus far. Career fair was exhausting but a really positive experience. After career fair, I finished up homework for my Algorithms course and me and my partner scrambled to finish Netflix, which went surprisingly well as we finished with just a handful of minor hiccups. That sprinkled in with intervview prep makes for a pretty tired Jamie.
