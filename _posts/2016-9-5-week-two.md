# What have you done this past week?


This past week has been a mess for me. Monday and Wednesday lectures were okay. We mostly discussed the Collatz project and Downing made it much clearer what needed to be done. For a guy that's never used most of these tools I know that helped a lot. But Wednesday night, it all went downhill. I fell very ill. I am feeling much better now but unfortunately, I didn't get much school work done during this long weekend and I had to settle for catching the Texas vs. Notre Dame game on TV (tragic, but at least we won #HookEm). Even more tragic, my family bought some Rudy's BBQ for the game and though I could smell that extra moist brisket I was stuck upstairs eating rice crackers and ramen noodle soup.

# What's in your way?

Well I had some set backs this past week and now it's time for me to play some catchup. This is going to be a long few days but if I give it my best shot I'm sure it will work out for me.

# What will you do next week?


This coming week I will complete and turn in Collatz. I haven't made much progress on Collatz but I'm feeling okay about it. The hints and clarifications Downing gave us in class Monday and Wednesday were very, very helpful. At this point, I know what I need to do, it's just a matter of getting it done. This week must be a productive one for me.

# Tip-of-the-Week


I specifically wanted to share a feature in an app that I discovered during my time in China this summer that I think could be the future of the restaurant industry. There is a messaging platform that pretty much every smart phone user in China has called WeChat. Aside from having really adorable and funny stickers which you can send to your friends, WeChat also utilizes the app's QR scanner to allow you to order and pay for food. 

It works like this: Every table in the restaurant is equipped with a QR code. To order, you bust out your WeChat app and scan the QR code, which weChat does through your camera. After reading the QR code, your phone will connect to a menu where you can add dishes to your online "tray", place an order and then pay. And because the QR code is paired with your table, the restaurant staff will know exactly where to bring your food and you didn't even have to talk to a single person. Boom. Restaurants eliminate their entire front end staff and customers don't have to deal with potential bad service.

Of course, there are caveats to this system. For example, no front end staff means that the customer is required to get their own water, silverware, etc. but with fast food restaurants already following this model, I wouldn't be surprised to see Facebook/Snapchat do something similar in the near future.
