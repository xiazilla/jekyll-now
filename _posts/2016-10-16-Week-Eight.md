title: OOP Week Eight!
---

# What have you done this past week?

This past week we spent some time in OOP talking about arrays, heap and stack and Downing gave us an implentation for a Vector class. We also spent time talking about allocators and how they actually manage and allocate memory. Me and my partner started working on the Allocator project a lot earlier, which is a nice change of pace from my partner and I's last second heroics for the Netflix project.  

# What's in my way?

I need to continue to work on the Allocator project. We've already done pretty much everything but the deallocate() function. We lost some points on the last project for some not-so-obvious things so this time around we need to be much more careful and triple check everything. Also, understanding how allocaters use sentinals to keep track of what's free and what's allocated just goes to show how simple it could be to make a mistake.

# What will I do this week?

This week will consist of finishing up this Allocator project, and various homework assignments for other classes. I have two interviews in the middle of the week, and luckily no tests. I'm hoping this week will be rather laid back.

# Tip-of-the-week

There's all sorts of opinions on why C++ or JAVA is better. This class obviously zones in on C++ but in case you're interested in finding examples and tutorials on how to do some of the stuff we've done in this class in JAVA (such as overriding equals), this guy is the goat. He has a bunch of android, js, frameworks, spring and other tutorials. All fairly simple to follow. Check it out:
