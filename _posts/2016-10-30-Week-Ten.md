# What have you done this past week?

On Monday, Downing introduced the Darwin project. Me and my partner took a brief look at it but haven't really made much progress. This project isn't as straight forward as the previous projects. For the other projects, it seemed like we could figure out what needed to be done and how to get that done very quickly - this project will require much more time spent in the planning phase. Then on Wednesday, Pariveda Solutions came in class to give a talk. I love those days because it's fun to talk to people who were sitting in our seats some years ago who've gone throught the college to job transition (Also, it means there's no way that Downing could cold call me in class). 

# What's in my way?

I somehow always find myself starting projects the week that they're due. This project does seem like it will take some more time so it's going to take some good effort to get it finished. That plus an Algorithms test on Wednesday will make for a busy week for me. 

# What will I do this week?

Darwin. Algorithm's Test. Sleep. Eat. Rinse and repeat. Until I turn in Darwin, after which, I will just do the 3rd thing.

# Pick-of-the-week

Check out computerphile on Youtube. I was recently introduced to it through someone else's pick of the week (I can't remember whose blog it was, sorry). Their youtube channel just covers really interesting computer science topics.
