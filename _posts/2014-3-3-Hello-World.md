title: OOP week one!

# What have you done this past week?

This week has been pretty standard as far as first-week-of-the-semester's go. We've all done this once or twice before: A slew of new classes and new topics to study and learn, the excitement of seeing all your friends again, feeling so very old as a pair of freshman walk by - one asking the other what the PCL is. Even the experienced make mistakes though, as I forgot to check out my classes in advance and got lost on the way to the first OOP lecture. I made it in time though and was able to enjoy two lectures last week where Downing covered the pros and cons in using asserts and ran through some code to compare and contrast C++ and JAVA, among other things. I also spent some time setting up this blog and Docker.

# What's in your way?

Right now, all that's in my way is my own inexperience. I've been exposed to but never coded in C++. I have also never before run into Docker prior to this course. Thankfully, the power of the internet is at my finger tips and office hours are God's gift to CS students. Nothing that can't be learned.

# What will you do next week?

Judging from the readings assigned, it seems that we will cover some fundamental OOP concepts like abstraction and inheritance. More importantly, it seems that we will begin talking about how to think like an Object Oriented Programmer. I also want to spend some time reading up on Docker and its features. We use a bunch of new tools in this class, good experience for the future.

# First impressions

Downing definitely has his own teaching style. This isn't your typical college lecture where a teacher will stand at the front of the classroom blabbing about some random topic. Downing keeps the class roster in front of him and scrolls down the list, choosing stdents to ask questions and discuss certain topics in class. This is a terrifying but effective way to keep my attention and focus on the lecture.

Downing also seems to gear his class towards helping his students get a job. He's mentioned that a few times during lecture and it shows in what he has us do. I am using many different and new tools in this class, most of which I'd never even heard of. This forces us to get accustomed to learning on the fly and adapting to new tools companies may have you use. Downing even forced us to take some time during class to exchange numbers and have a conversation with a peer. He wants us to know that you can have all the programming knowledge in the world but if you aren't amiable you will be a tough hire. Also by asking us to keep this blog, Downing is giving us an opportunity to practice explaining our thoughts and ideas. This is something I definitel appreciate.

# Tip-of-the-Week

JAVA and XML are two very powerful languages that are very compatable with each other. One could go as far to say that JAVA and XML are the Kim Kardashian and Kanye West of the programming language world (Just kidding. I should really apologize for that joke. Dissappointed in myself). In any case, at my internship this summer I worked on a trace analysis tool written in JAVA that needed to be made more adaptable. I did this easily using Java's DOM XML Parser which my mentor recommended. I had never even seen XML before my mentor mentioned it and I completed that portion of my task very fast and very easily with the help of this tutorial:
