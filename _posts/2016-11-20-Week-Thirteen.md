# What have you done this past week?

This past week me and my partner finished up our life project. It was nice getting it done and turned in before the turn-in date (as opposed to my usual strategy of wokring 12 hours on the turn in date and hitting submit at 9:40).

In class we talked about Abstract Classes in C++ and how the differ from JAVA. We also talked about inheritance and virtual functions.

# What's in my way?

With a half week this week and the semester nearing its end, I can tell that I will really have to strain myself to be productive. I've already spent this weekend celebrating birthdays and doing nothing which felt oh so good. There is just one more round of tests I need to get through and a month long break will be waiting for me on the other side.

# What will I do this week?

I have an algorithms assignment due Wednesday and afterwards, I'm looking forward to spending Thanksgiving with my family. My younger brother has moved out and started college at UT so I know they're going to be excited to have us all back home. 

# Pick-of-the-week

One thing that is becoming increasingly popular in the computer science field is AI. I personally think as we continue to learn more and more about machine learning, AI will continue to increase its presence in people's everyday life.
