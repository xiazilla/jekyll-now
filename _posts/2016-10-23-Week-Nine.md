title: OOP Week Nine!

# What have you done this past week?

This past week, I finished up the Allocator project with my partner. Also, we spent time in class writing the template for a vector class. I like how Downing has us spend time in class to write certain methods on our own before we go over how to write them together. It's a refreshing change of pace from professors who just ramble on quickly about a topic, forcing you to just scribble notes without getting a chance to think about what we're actually covering. I also appreciate hearing the optimizations Downing gives us such as the Vector constructors we wrote in Monday's and Friday's classes.

# What's in my way?

Right now, I feel okay about where I stand in most of my classes. I need to get my stuff together on Downing's quizzes though. Those are not treating me very well.

# What will I do this week?

This week, I will look to get started on project 4. I have yet to read the project spec so I'm pretty curious to see what this Darwinism project is about.

# Tip-of-the-week

My tip of the week will continue the trend of my recent blogs (which I know all of you are following because posting my weekly blog at 11 o'clock every Sunday gets me the most viewership). I'm going to share with y'all a great HTML/CSS tutorial page. Here's the link:
