title: OOP week six!
---

# What have you done this past week?

The first half of this past week was spent preparing for my Algorithms test on Wednesday, and the second half, in sharp contrast, was spent with minimal to no productivity. I didn't do much on Thursday and on Friday and Saturday I was hopping from stage to stage with my people and getting #crunk to some live music at ACLfest. In class this week, we talked about templates, constructors, destructors, the const keyword, and wrote a range iterator class.

# What's in my way?

Well, for now, all that's in my way is enjoying this 3rd day of ACL. But when reality comes crashing back down on me, I will need to get a plan going on how to study for my 2 tests this week and just balancing life between work, interviews, and school.

# What will I do this week?

This week is pretty straight forward as far as school goes. Test Monday. Test Thurs. I have a lot to do in particular to get ready for this OOP test.

If you're interested in seeing what the next generation of technology has to offer, you should check out the atx startup crawl. I've never been before but it sounds like a fun time and a good place to network with some tech people. If you want to rsvp, follow this link:
