# What have you done this past week?

This past week was mostly spent reviewing what we have learned thus far in preperation for Wednesday's test, aside from Monday's class in which we learned about the const keyword using a very helpful paintball gun metaphor.

# What's in my way?

Now that Wednesday's test has ended, I am starting on a clean slate for test two. I want to do everything that I can to keep up with readings and start on project 3 as early as possible. 

# What will I do this week?

This week will consist of getting ahead. I have no major tests or projects due. I want to also use this time to prepare for interviews.

# Tip-of-the-week

The career fair day is always a very intense day in the year. You have just five hours to talk to as many of the over one hundred employers present. You can get through a handful if you try hard enough but no matter what there will not be enough time in the day to talk to everyone on your list. Luckily, your recruitment does not have to end there.
