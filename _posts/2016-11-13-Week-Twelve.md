title: OOP Week Twelve!
---

# What have you done this past week?

This past week me and my partner got started on the Life project. The life project is a great opportunity for me to continue practicing OO design and implement OO concepts like abstraction and inheritance. Honestly, projects like Life and Darwin were the kind of projects that I wanted when I signed up for this class. The experience with C++ and tools like Docker, Travis CI, and git were all little bonuses that I got to pick up along the way. Though I will say, we did not spend as much time on Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism and other OOP concepts as I expected.

This week in class, we spent some time discussing life project on Monday. What's tricky about this project is that a board can have both Fredkin Cells and Conway Cells which are wrapped within a Cell class and stored using an Abstract Cell pointer. So there's many levels of abstraction to work through in getting information from one class to another, and it becomes even more tricky with the whole no getters and setters rule.

# What's in my way?

Not much. Just going to continue the school grind. We have just 3 more weeks until winter break and just one more round of tests.

# What will I do this week?

No major tests this week. Just need to finish up Life and a few more assignments for other classes.
