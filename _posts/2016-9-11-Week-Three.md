title: OOP week three!

# What have you done this past week?

Started, finished and turned in project one. For the first time in my brief UTCS life, writing the code was the easiest part of the project. I struggled with confusing error messages, mysterious failing Travis builds, and just generally figuring out what needed to be done in preperation for turnin. The initial setup of the environment was rough for me as docker just didn't seem compatible with my windows system and I had to invest some time in figuring how how to configure and use each tool. This is okay with me though as setting up and adapting to a new work environment is something that I had to deal with at my internship this summer and a process that needs to be done at any new workplace. The only frustrating thing about project one was the turn in process. I just wish a make grade or some other sample script was provided by the graders so that students could ensure that they wouldn't be breaking the graders' script.

# What's in your way?

This past week Downing lectured on C++ references and pointers. References are something completely new to me. I kind of think of them as pointers that are immediately dereferenced. Even though I've worked with pointers in C the past two semesters, this was a concept that still confuses me a little. So I need to spend some time and really understand these fundamental concepts.

# What will you do next week?

This week I need to spend some time to catch up on the readings. My quiz grades have been dismal to say the least and the reason for that is because I'm falling behind on the class readings.

# Pick-of-the-Week

This is something that's not really CS related. There is a really cool organization out there that some of y'all may or may not be interested in. It's called World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms or WWOOF. This organization allows you to travel to another country, where a host farm will house and feed you. In return you volunteer 6 hours a day on their farm and get to experience life and culture on an organic farm in a new country. If you're more curious about it, check this link out. http://wwoofinternational.org/how-it-works/
