title: OOP week eleven!

# What have you done this past week?

It was a long week for oop. We had our darwin project due. This project was really similar to a project I did in 312 but it was especially challenging in this class because of the fact that we weren't allowed to use getters and setters. The most challenging part was finding creative ways to pass information from other classes to each other. For example, we had to figure out a way of accessing the Darwin board from the species class without passing in the entire Darwin board. We tried many methods but in the end decided that passing in memory addresses of the index in the array was the best option. I learned a lot from this project.

In class this week we finished up vectors on Monday and Wednesday, and on Friday we discussed the 4 different types of variables - local, local static, global and global static, and their differences in Java and C++.

# What's in your way?

I was on a huge time crunch to finish project 4 so I plan to start project 5 much, much earlier. Also, constructor quizzes have been wrecking me. Need to step my game up there.

# What will you do next week?

Start Life project and get ahead in other classes!

# Tip-of-the-Week

For most of us, recruiting season for this semester is dwindling down to an end. But I was browsing the web the other day and came across these interesting non-technical google interview questions. Give this a read and see how you do! (The answers are linked as well)
